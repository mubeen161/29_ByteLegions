        <h2>WE STUDENTS OF MJCET SOLVING THIS PROBLEM STATEMENT USING AI/ML MODEL</h2>
        <h4>An “intelligent” computer uses AI to think like a human and perform tasks on its own. 
            Machine learning is how a computer system develops its intelligence.
            One way to train a computer to mimic human reasoning , which is a series of algorithms that are modeled after the human brain.
            One domain where such recommender systems can play a significant role to help college graduates to fulfil their dreams by 
            recommending a job based on their interest and skillset.. Simultaneously, existing job recommendation systems only take into consideration the domain in which
            the user is interested while ignoring their profile and skillset, which can help recommend jobs which are tailor made for the user. Our
            AI-ML model suggest User with roadmap with related to his/her Field. It predicts the Best Possible Stream User could Opt for . We train our ML Model with 
            current Trends and Future Scopes. We will Suggest Courses for improving Skills . We will be looking for Motivational Videos ,
            Skills development programs and as well as Career Guidance . Our Advantage is being College Students we have a proper idea of Students mentality , how lack of resources can effect planning ,
            how lack of Guidance led to faulty decisions . AI-Ml is Future of our building nation , Our Nation is based on Our Youths. 
            Hence we AIM to provide as much knowledge as we can with our Model.
